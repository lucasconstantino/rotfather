            This is the story of a rat called Al Kane, who lives in New York's sewers in the 40s. 
            During the underworlds prohibition of sugar commercialization he built an empire out of trafficking, 
            creating a very powerful mafia system. But after the mysterious death of his right-hand man, 
            he was betrayed, beaten up and left for dead by the hands of a cockroach gang. Now he is back to figure out what 
            happened and who betrayed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He will try to recover his empire, each area at a time, exploring a sewer system that is connected by complex pathways. 
            He also has to free his partners who controlled each of the sugar distribution points. Immersed in a sea of intrigue, 
            where animals and insects live and work both together and against each other, he doesn't know who to trust. 
            The only thing he knows is where everything begins: in Madam Laura's Cabaret...
